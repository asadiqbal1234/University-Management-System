# University Management System Using PHP and MySQL

This University Management System in PHP project focuses on dealing with a variety of records such as student attendance, grades, faculties, and so on.
The system also shows all of the available records of available faculties, students, and their grades, among other things.
There are three sections to this project: administration, student, and faculty. In a high-level view of this web app, the administrator has complete control over the system, including student attendance management for various days.
Furthermore, the administrator has the authority to assign grades to students in each topic.

The admin can check the overall result of each student with their CGPA after setting up the student’s grades.
Additionally, an administrator has the ability to download student and teacher records.

# University Management System Project: Student and Faculty Panel

A user, on the other hand, can simply register as a student by providing information such as their name, university ID, address, course, and date of birth, as well as creating login credentials.

A student account can access this page to examine his or her total results for each topic as well as change his or her personal user profile.

To see the outcomes, the administrator must first make a notation on a student’s record.
Faculty members can do the same by registering and logging onto the system. Students’ attendance can be taken by a teaching member, who can also see general attendance and edit their profiles.
As a result, a faculty account’s sole function is to keep track of attendance.
